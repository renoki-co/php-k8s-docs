# âœ¨ Create classes for CRDs

The ease of using basic Kubernetes resources can be extended into creating CRDs for your custom use case. This needs a lot of context about what you can apply to the resources, based on your needs.

In these examples, we will be looking at the [Traefik CRDs](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/providers/kubernetes-crd) and [Agones CRDs](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/tree/main/install/helm/agones/templates/crds). The versions might differ from the actual live Traefik docs, it's just for the example purposes.
