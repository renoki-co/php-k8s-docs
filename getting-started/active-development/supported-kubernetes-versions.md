# ðŸ§™ Supported Kubernetes versions

While there are many Kubernetes versions in the wild, we can't test them all as the development continues. The best we can do is to keep the last 3 Kubernetes releases into our testing cycles and update the documentation and resource defaults accordingly.

For a version that you use and the package does not display the Kubernetes `vx.xx Ready` badges, **it doesn't mean it's not supported at all.** It's just not tested for the latest versions and you can keep an eye on the [Releases page](https://github.com/renoki-co/php-k8s/releases) to see what versions are tested out with.
